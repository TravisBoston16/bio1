## 1. Introduction to Tidyverse

The Tidyverse is a coherent ecosystem of R packages designed for data science. These packages share common principles and are designed to work together seamlessly. The core principles include:

-   **Tidy Data**: Each variable is a column, each observation is a row
-   **Consistency**: All packages share similar design philosophy and grammar
-   **Pipe-Oriented**: Uses the %\>% operator for chaining operations
-   **Functional Programming**: Embraces functional programming concepts

Let's start by loading all Tidyverse packages:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

# View all installed tidyverse packages
tidyverse_packages()
```

## 2. dplyr: Data Manipulation

dplyr is the workhorse of data manipulation in R. It provides a grammar of data manipulation through a set of verbs (functions) that solve the most common data manipulation challenges.

### 2.1 Core Functions (The Five Main Verbs)

#### select(): Column Selection

The select() function is used to choose which columns you want to focus on. It's particularly useful when dealing with datasets with many variables.

```{r}
# Load sample data
data(mtcars)

# Basic column selection
mtcars %>%
  select(mpg, cyl, wt)  # Select specific columns
  
# Advanced selection with helper functions
mtcars %>%
  select(
    starts_with("m"),    # Select columns starting with 'm'
    ends_with("t"),      # Select columns ending with 't'
    contains("p")        # Select columns containing 'p'
  )
```

#### filter(): Row Selection

filter() allows you to subset rows based on logical conditions. You can combine multiple conditions using & (and) and \| (or).

```{r}
# Basic filtering
mtcars %>%
  filter(mpg > 20, cyl == 6)  # Cars with MPG > 20 AND 6 cylinders

# Complex filtering
mtcars %>%
  filter(
    between(mpg, 15, 25),     # MPG between 15 and 25
    cyl %in% c(4, 6)          # Cylinder is either 4 or 6
  )
```

#### arrange(): Ordering Rows

arrange() orders the rows based on one or more columns. By default, it arranges in ascending order; use desc() for descending order.

```{r}
# Basic ordering
mtcars %>%
  arrange(mpg)               # Sort by MPG (ascending)

# Multiple ordering criteria
mtcars %>%
  arrange(desc(mpg), wt)     # First by MPG (descending), then by weight
```

#### mutate(): Creating New Variables

mutate() adds new columns that are functions of existing columns. It's powerful for creating derived metrics.

```{r}
# Creating new variables
mtcars %>%
  mutate(
    weight_kg = wt * 453.592,        # Convert weight to kilograms
    efficiency = mpg / wt,           # Calculate efficiency metric
    efficiency_category = case_when(  # Create categorical variable
      efficiency < 8 ~ "low",
      efficiency < 12 ~ "medium",
      TRUE ~ "high"
    )
  )
