# R Data Analysis Tutorial for Beginners

This tutorial will guide you through the process of basic data analysis using R. We will use R's built-in datasets `iris` and `mtcars` to demonstrate various data operations and analysis techniques.

## 1. Loading Datasets

First, we need to load the datasets we'll be using. R has many built-in datasets, and we'll use two of them: `iris` and `mtcars`.

```{r}
data(iris)
data(mtcars)
```

These two lines of code will load the `iris` and `mtcars` datasets into our R environment.

## 2. Viewing Basic Dataset Information

Basic data structure, Vector

```{r}
# numeric
numeric_vector <- c(1, 2, 3, 4.5)
integer_vector <- c(1L, 2L, 3L)  # 'L' 表示整数

# character
char_vector <- c("a", "b", "c")

# logical
logical_vector <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)

# complex
complex_vector <- c(1+2i, 3-4i)

# raw
raw_vector <- as.raw(c(1, 2, 3))

# factor
factor_vector <- factor(c("small", "medium", "large"))

# date
date_vector <- as.Date(c("2023-01-01", "2023-01-02"))

# check type
sapply(list(numeric_vector, integer_vector, char_vector, logical_vector, 
            complex_vector, raw_vector, factor_vector, date_vector), class)
```

Factor looks unfamiliar?

Categorical variable (Ordered & Unordered)

```{r}
education <- factor(c("High School", "Bachelor", "Master", "PhD","High School"),
                    levels = c("High School", "Bachelor", "Master", "PhD"),
                    ordered = TRUE)
education
```

With that knowledge, we canBefore start the analysis, we need to understand our datasets. We can use several functions to view the basic structure and statistical information of the data.

```{r}
# View the first few rows of data
head(iris)
head(mtcars)

print("-------- data structure --------")
# View data structure
str(iris)
print("-------- cars --------")
str(mtcars)

print("-------- data summary --------")
# View data summary
summary(iris)
print("-------- cars --------")
summary(mtcars)
```

The `head()` function displays the first few rows of the dataset. The `str()` function shows the structure of the data, including variable types and some sample values. The `summary()` function provides basic statistical information for each variable.

## 3. Basic Operations on Data Frames

Data frames in R are very flexible data structures, allowing us to easily select, modify, and add data.

### Selecting Rows and Columns

```{r}
# Select the first column of the iris dataset
print("iris first column")
iris[, 1] # Here in [,], the first element is the row index, the second is the column index

# Select the mpg column of the mtcars dataset
print("mt cars mpg")
mtcars$mpg       

# Select the 1st to 3rd columns of the iris dataset
iris[, 1:3]      

# Select rows where Species is setosa
subset(iris, Species == "setosa")   

# Select rows where mpg is greater than 20
subset(mtcars, mpg > 20)
